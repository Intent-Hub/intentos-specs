# Roadmap v1 – IntentHub → IntentOS

This roadmap describes the high-level evolution from the conceptual layer (IntentHub) to a stable runtime (IntentOS v1).

Planned stages (indicative):

1. **Foundations**
   - stabilize core models (Intent, Template, Playbook, Execution),
   - lock in Triad Topology and Big Context principles,
   - publish v1.0 of the specs.

2. **Runtime Integration**
   - align `intentos-core` with the Intent Memory Engine spec,
   - align the AI Aikido Gateway with the Gateway / Skill Leasing model,
   - provide reference Playbook Execution Engine.

3. **Tooling & UX**
   - Intent Builder UX,
   - Playbook authoring tools,
   - admin/observability panels.

4. **Feedback & Induction**
   - standardized feedback endpoints,
   - Auto-Builder / induction experiments,
   - evaluation loops and quality metrics.

5. **Ecosystem & Standardization**
   - reference integrations,
   - community RFCs,
   - candidate proposals for “IntentHub Standard v2”.

This document is intentionally high-level.
