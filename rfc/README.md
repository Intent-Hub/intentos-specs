# RFC Guidelines

This directory contains **Request for Comments (RFC)** documents that evolve the IntentHub specifications.

Use RFCs when you want to:

- introduce a new core concept,
- change an existing model or contract,
- deprecate or replace a major component,
- define integration patterns that others may depend on.

General workflow:

1. Create a new file `NNNN-short-title.md`.
2. Copy the structure from an existing RFC.
3. Fill in: Motivation, Design, Alternatives, Drawbacks, Migration.
4. Open a discussion (GitHub issue, PR, or external thread).
5. Once accepted, mark the RFC as “Accepted” and update the main spec if needed.

RFCs are the change log of the IntentHub standard.
